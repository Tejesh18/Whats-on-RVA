# Data Index — A City That Tells Its Stories

This index covers known and potential data sources for both targeted problem statements in this pillar. Entries are organized by source type. Verification status is marked where known.

Teams should treat all entries as **[Unverified]** until they personally confirm access and format during the hackathon.

## Arts & Cultural Event Data Sources

### Eventbrite API
- Type: REST API
- Access: Public search endpoint available; enhanced access requires API key registration
- Scope: Public events listed on Eventbrite; many Richmond arts organizations and venues publish here
- Fields: event title, date, time, venue, description, category, URL, organizer
- Limitations: Only covers events explicitly listed on Eventbrite; does not aggregate events from other platforms
- Hackathon use: Pull Richmond-area events by location, filter by arts/culture categories

- Reference: https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api

### Facebook Events (Graph API)
- Type: REST API (heavily restricted post-2018 Cambridge Analytica changes)
- Access: Public event discovery via the Graph API is severely limited; requires app review for many features

- Limitations: Facebook significantly restricted public event data access. Current public access is minimal. Do not plan your MVP around Facebook Events data availability.
- Hackathon use: [Unverified — treat as likely inaccessible without significant prior approval]

- Note: The rubric explicitly identifies "No arts/cultural event data in open data catalog" as a gap. This is a known problem, not a hackathon-buildable solution.

---

## What is missing and why it matters

The rubric notes these as explicit gaps:
1. No structured arts/cultural event data in the open data catalog
2. No confirmed list of Richmond arts organizations with RSS/calendar feeds
3. Arts & Cultural Districts boundary data not confirmed in GeoHub
4. No documentation of how residents currently discover arts events
5. No structured resident story corpus exists
6. Oral history collections at museums: scope, format, and accessibility are undocumented

Teams working in this pillar will need to do some of their own data scouting during the first hours of the hackathon. The research prompts in `05_prompts/research/` are designed to help with this.
