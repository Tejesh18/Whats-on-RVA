# Build Fast on Trusted Feeds: Richmond Arts + Oral Histories You Can Use Today

## Executive Summary

For a 48-hour hackathon, success depends on avoiding brittle data pipelines and leveraging stable, public infrastructure. The most viable path for the "City Storytelling" MVP is building on top of the **Richmond CultureWorks** events feed, overlaying it on **Richmond GeoHub** arts district boundaries, and embedding public oral histories from **VCU Libraries** and **StoryCorps**. 

Key strategic directives for your build:
* **CultureWorks is your events backbone**: With over 1,200 local arts events and stable iCal/RSS feeds, this is the only plug-and-play data source. Avoid Eventbrite and Facebook entirely, as their discovery APIs are deprecated or heavily gated.
* **Embed oral histories, don't host them**: VCU Libraries hosts the Historic Fulton and Carver oral history collections with public streaming access. Deep-link or iframe these resources rather than scraping audio, and explicitly credit The Valentine as the copyright holder for the Fulton collection.
* **Consent and transparency are product requirements**: If your tool collects user stories, you must implement plain-language consent flows aligned with Oral History Association (OHA) standards. Any aggregated data must display an AAPOR-compliant disclaimer noting it is a non-representative sample.

## MVP Decision Frame: Ship on CultureWorks + VCU/StoryCorps

The fastest reliable path to a working prototype is a CultureWorks-powered events layer combined with VCU/StoryCorps narratives, visualized over verified City of Richmond GIS data. 

This shape wins because it delivers instantly live Richmond events without requiring complex scraping or API approvals. It utilizes high-credibility oral histories that are already cleared for public access, and it grounds the storytelling in verified City GIS boundaries (Arts District and Incentive Zones) to provide immediate geographic context.

## Event Ingestion Plan: Reliable Feeds, Minimal Risk

Your primary engineering effort for events should focus on parsing and caching the CultureWorks feeds. Attempting to scrape dynamic sites or bypass API restrictions will consume your weekend with zero output.

### Primary Feed: Richmond CultureWorks
Richmond CultureWorks is confirmed live and actively maintained. 
* **Endpoints**: Use `https://calendar.richmondcultureworks.org/calendar/1.ics` for calendar data or `https://calendar.richmondcultureworks.org/calendar/1.xml` for RSS.
* **Cadence**: Poll every 10–15 minutes and cache parsed items to avoid hammering the server.
* **Engineering notes**: Normalize timezones, deduplicate by UID/link, and map venue addresses to lat/long coordinates for map pins. Maintain the original source organization from the feed item fields and display it in your UI.

### Blocked and High-Lift Sources to Avoid
Do not attempt to build around Eventbrite or Facebook. Eventbrite's public search was deprecated in 2020, and Facebook Events requires Marketing Partner status. Furthermore, local publications like Style Weekly and RVA Magazine rely on client-side JavaScript or lack discoverable RSS/iCal endpoints, making them high-lift scraping targets that are too brittle for a weekend build.

## Comparative Viability: Event Sources at a Glance

| Source | Feed Type | Access Status | Engineering Lift | Verdict | Source URL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Richmond CultureWorks** | ICS, RSS | Public | Low | **Use as primary** | https://calendar.richmondcultureworks.org/ |
| **VMFA (Localist)** | iCal/RSS | Aggregated by CultureWorks | Medium | Skip direct; rely on CultureWorks | https://vmfa.museum/calendar/ |
| **ICA at VCU** | None found | Public site only | High | Skip direct; rely on CultureWorks | https://icavcu.org/events/ |
| **Style Weekly** | None | Client-side JS | High | Avoid automated ingestion | https://styleweekly.com/events |
| **RVA Magazine** | Unclear | No endpoints discovered | High | Avoid; optional manual curation | https://rvamag.com/ |
| **Eventbrite Search** | REST | Deprecated/removed | N/A | Out of scope | N/A |
| **Facebook Events** | Graph API | Gated | N/A | Out of scope | N/A |

*Takeaway: Richmond CultureWorks is the only viable automated data source for a weekend hackathon. Relying on it eliminates the need to build individual scrapers for the VMFA, ICA, or local magazines.*

## GIS Overlay Integration: Arts Districts You Can Ship Today

Official Arts and Cultural District layers are confirmed on the Richmond GeoHub. Overlaying these polygons contextualizes the event data and fulfills the civic technology mandate.

* **Datasets**: Access the "Arts and Cultural District" and "Arts and Cultural District Incentive Zones" via the Richmond GeoHub (ArcGIS Hub).
* **Formats**: Download GeoJSON or Shapefile formats directly via the ArcGIS Hub standard interface.
* **Implementation**: Download the GeoJSON once for the demo and cache it locally. Load the polygons into your web map (e.g., Leaflet or MapLibre), style the overlays, and cluster the CultureWorks event pins within or near these boundaries. Credit "City of Richmond GeoHub" on the map interface.

## Oral History Integration: Public, Embeddable, Rights-Aware

VCU Libraries and StoryCorps provide rich, linkable content. Your prototype must respect institutional rights and attribution, particularly regarding The Valentine's copyright ownership.

### VCU Libraries Collections
VCU Libraries hosts two major publicly accessible Richmond neighborhood oral history collections. The Historic Fulton Oral History Project contains 17 interviews with 32 named interviewees [1]. Full streaming copies of all audio interviews are available for use through this digital collection, and each interview has been fully transcribed and is searchable [2]. 

### Rights and Product Decisions
The material in the Historic Fulton collection is protected by copyright, and the copyright is held by The Valentine [2]. Non-commercial use of this material is permitted, but commercial use requires permission [2]. 
* **Action**: Deep-link or embed VCU item pages instead of re-hosting the media. Display a rights text summary on each story card (e.g., "Copyright: The Valentine; non-commercial use permitted").

## Comparative Viability: Oral History Sources

| Source | Access | Formats | Rights/Notes | Verdict | URL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **VCU Carver** | Public | MP3, PDF | Public access | Use, embed/deep-link | https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/car/ |
| **VCU Fulton** | Public | Streaming audio, transcripts | Copyright: The Valentine [2] | Use with rights note | https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/ful/ |
| **StoryCorps** | Public | Embedded audio | Location tag filtering needed | Use as supplement | https://archive.storycorps.org |
| **The Valentine** | Public DB | Mixed | Rights holder [2]; no direct stream | Use for metadata/rights | https://thevalentine.org/collections/ |

*Takeaway: VCU-hosted collections are your safest, richest baseline for immediate integration. The Valentine should be credited as the rights holder for the Fulton collection, but their direct site is best used for database research rather than streaming.*

## Ethics, Consent, and Disclaimers: Do It Right From Day One

If your prototype includes a story collection feature or displays aggregated insights, you must adopt OHA-aligned consent and AAPOR transparency standards to ensure credibility.

### Transparency and Limitations
The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) disclosure standards mandate that all research has limitations and researchers will include a general statement acknowledging limitations of the design and data collection [3]. 
* **Action**: Place a UI disclaimer on all aggregate insights or maps generated from user submissions: *"Based on voluntarily submitted stories — not a representative sample."*

### Informed Consent
The Oral History Association (OHA) defines informed consent as an agreement that documents, verbally or in writing, that the narrator has been given all the information necessary to come to a decision [4]. Participating in an oral history interview may involve signing specific types of agreements or assigning intellectual property rights, such as a formal agreement or release form [5].
* **Action**: Implement a plain-language consent flow for any new story submissions. Run a non-engineer read-aloud test prior to the demo to ensure the language is easily understood.

## 48-Hour Implementation Plan: Sequenced to Win

**Day 1: Infrastructure and Data**
* Parse the CultureWorks ICS feed, normalize the data, and display it in a list/grid with source attribution.
* Download the GeoHub Arts District GeoJSON, overlay it on your map, and geocode event venues to drop pins.
* Add VCU Fulton and Carver story cards using deep-links or embeds, ensuring rights notes are prominently displayed.

**Day 2: Polish and Ethics**
* Add StoryCorps search functionality and embed selected narratives.
* Implement caching and error handling for the CultureWorks feed.
* Add AAPOR-compliant disclaimers and finalize OHA-aligned consent copy (run the read-aloud test).
* Conduct mobile QA, verify map pan/zoom performance, and finalize the attribution footer.

### Priority 2 — Verify Before Building Data Pipeline

**RVA Magazine events**
* **Status**: CANNOT VERIFY (Usable automated feeds)
* **Official Source URL**: https://rvamag.com/
* **Key Details**: Endpoints such as `/events/feed/` and `/?ical=1` were tested, but no usable RSS or iCal feeds were discovered. 
* **Corrections/Notes**: Treat this as a high-lift scrape. Do not attempt automated ingestion during the hackathon. Rely on CultureWorks, which likely overlaps content, or use manual curation if RVA Magazine specific events are strictly required.

### Priority 3 — Verify Before Finalizing Story Collection Design

**The Valentine digital collections**
* **Status**: CONFIRMED (As rights holder and database host)
* **Official Source URL**: https://thevalentine.org/collections/ [6]
* **Key Details**: The Valentine has an online collection database [7]. However, the streaming digital collection for the Historic Fulton Oral History Project is hosted by VCU Libraries [2]. The Valentine holds the copyright for this material [2].
* **Corrections/Notes**: Do not look for a dedicated streaming portal on The Valentine's site. Use the VCU Libraries links for streaming, but explicitly attribute copyright to The Valentine.

**Consent language review**
* **Status**: CONFIRMED (Guidelines exist; manual team review required)
* **Official Source URL**: https://oralhistory.org/informed-consent/ [4]
* **Key Details**: The Oral History Association requires an agreement documenting that the narrator has been given all information necessary to make a decision [4]. This often involves a formal release form [5].
* **Corrections/Notes**: Hackathon teams must draft plain-language consent based on OHA templates and conduct a human read-aloud test before the demo.

### Priority 4 — Verify Before Demo

**All event sources show real Richmond events**
* **Status**: CONFIRMED (Path identified)
